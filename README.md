# **Urban Homes**

Urban Homes is a responsive real estate property management platform that allows users to browse property listings, log in for a simulated personalized experience, and receive AI-driven property recommendations. Due to time constraints, database integration was not implemented, and the application uses dummy data for demonstration purposes.
